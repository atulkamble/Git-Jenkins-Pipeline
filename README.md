Certainly! Let's walk through setting up a very basic Jenkins pipeline project using Git. This will include minimal setup and steps to ensure you can see a simple pipeline in action.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Prerequisites
1. Jenkins installed and running.
2. Git installed and a repository ready.
3. Basic understanding of Jenkins and Git.

#### Step 1: Install Jenkins and Necessary Plugins
- Ensure Jenkins is installed on your server. Refer to the [Jenkins installation guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).
- Install the required plugins: Pipeline and Git plugins.
  - Navigate to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available**.
  - Search for "Pipeline" and "Git Plugin", and install them.

#### Step 2: Create a Git Repository
Create a simple Git repository with a basic project structure. Here's an example using a simple shell script.

```sh
mkdir git-jenkins-pipeline
cd git-jenkins-pipeline
git init
echo 'echo "Hello, Jenkins!"' > hello.sh
chmod +x hello.sh
```

Create a `Jenkinsfile` in the same directory:

```sh
echo 'pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage("Clone Repository") {
            steps {
                git "https://github.com/atulkamble/Git-Jenkins-Pipeline.git"
            }
        }

        stage("Build") {
            steps {
                sh "./hello.sh"
            }
        }
    }
}' > Jenkinsfile
```

Commit and push the changes to your Git repository:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Jenkinsfile and hello.sh"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/basic-jenkins-project.git
git push -u origin master
```

#### Step 3: Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job
1. Open Jenkins in your web browser.
2. Click on **New Item**.
3. Enter a name for your job, select **Pipeline**, and click **OK**.
4. In the **Pipeline** section, choose **Pipeline script from SCM**.
5. Set **SCM** to **Git**.
6. Enter the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/basic-jenkins-project.git`) and, if necessary, credentials.
7. Specify the script path as `Jenkinsfile`.
8. Click **Save**.

#### Step 4: Run the Pipeline
- Go to your Jenkins dashboard and click on the newly created pipeline job.
- Click **Build Now** to run the pipeline.
- Monitor the build progress and check the console output for each stage.

### Example Directory Structure

```plaintext
basic-jenkins-project/
├── hello.sh
└── Jenkinsfile
```

### Detailed `Jenkinsfile`

Here’s the complete `Jenkinsfile`:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage("Clone Repository") {
            steps {
                git "https://github.com/your-username/basic-jenkins-project.git"
            }
        }

        stage("Build") {
            steps {
                sh "./hello.sh"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Expected Output
When you run the pipeline, you should see the following output in the build logs:

```plaintext
[Pipeline] Start of Pipeline
[Pipeline] node
Running on Jenkins in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/basic-jenkins-project
[Pipeline] {
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Clone Repository)
[Pipeline] git
Cloning the remote Git repository
...
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Build)
[Pipeline] sh
+ ./hello.sh
Hello, Jenkins!
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // node
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
Finished: SUCCESS
```

This simple setup demonstrates a basic Jenkins pipeline that clones a repository and runs a shell script. You can expand this pipeline by adding more stages and steps as needed for your projects.
